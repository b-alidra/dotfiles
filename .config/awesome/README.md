# peikk0's config for awesome 3.4

This config primarily intented for use on a FreeBSD system, and is also a
little adapted for Gentoo, but without full support (no system stats, etc.).

Additionnal libraries used in this config can be installed in lib/ directory:

  - [mpd.lua](https://github.com/peikk0/lua-mpd) (need Lua socket library)
  - [sysctl.lua](https://github.com/peikk0/lua-sysctl) (FreeBSD only)

Also, you may need to install the lua_filesystem library in order to have ACPI
support on Linux.

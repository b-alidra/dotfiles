= geekounet's config for awesome 3.4 =

This config primarily intented for use on a FreeBSD system, and is also a
little adapted for Debian, but without full support (no system stats, etc.).

It is hosted in a mercurial repository at this location:
  https://hg.poildetroll.net/hg/config/awesome/

Additionnal libraries used in this config can be installed in lib/ directory:

  - mpd.lua: https://hg.poildetroll.net/hg/config/awesome/lua-mpd/ (need Lua socket library)
  - sysctl.lua: https://hg.poildetroll.net/hg/config/awesome/lua-sysctl/ (FreeBSD only)

Also, you may need to install the lua_filesystem library in order to have ACPI
support on Linux.
